I just realized it's been at least a month I did not do anything to my side projects. I had to invest some extra time to my job projects. I know I had some free time after work, but I wasn't in the mood for it lately. But change is needed.

I'm postponing the project on Rest API with NODE.js. I'd like to try something other than web development. Maybe getting familiar with creating a mobile application?

I should focus more on Time Management to increase my time efficiency. A great article about it can be found [here](https://medium.com/@WeAreMobile1st/9-time-management-tips-for-developers-d8a7f7a2d73).
