I’ve always wanted to create my own personal website where I could mention my projects, ideas, notes, practices and now it’s finally here! After graduation at VSB-TUO, I have a little bit more time to focus on these goals, apart from the projects being done in work.

The projects, I’m going to publish here, will be focused on technologies I do not normally come in contact with.

I hope, that posting new posts, will not last as long as my commitment to run my website.
