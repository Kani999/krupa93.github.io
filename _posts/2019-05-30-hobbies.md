What is your way to free up your mind and boost up your energy?

Sometimes I'm pretty tired from staring into a monitor and sitting all day. So my way to get rid off this routine is to stand up and do some movement activities.

It's been almost a year since I started swimming in the pool three or four times a week in the morning before work. And I must say it's a great way to start the day. I feel more relaxed, energic and also I throw away all the worries during a swim. 
At first, I was unable to swim anything but breaststrokes. But after a few lessons with a trainer, I can swim freestyle quite good. My record is 3km of freestyle in a 1h6m and I hope I'll beat that soon!

I also like to go to the gym about three times a week. But if the weather is nice and the temperature is high, I prefer hiking or street workout in the open air. I can't be locked in the room all the time.

*And what is your recipe for a relaxed mind?*
