I just created a very very very simple Node JS REST API which runs Todo list application. Well, Todo list application is a strong name, because it contains only one table with name and status property. But this project wasn't about creating a perfect application, but to get in the first touch with `Node`.

I spent only a few hours on this project and I must say, I struggled a little bit with Node basics.
I could not find any best practices on how to accomplish so simple task.
There is too much way to create an app (and as far as go my research almost nobody does it the same way). So as a total beginner in Node, I have some difficult time to set everything up.

It's a flexible structure and lack of strict guidelines makes it seem more complicated for me than it probably is. 
I found some packages which help a lot with running a server to accept requirements, setup environment values or connect to Database (MySql).
But I did not use any package for defining the model (Todo) yet.

I have to do a lot of improvements in this project to make this at least good. Then I want to create a React project to make some views which will serve the API requests. (Maybe in style of some Microservices?)

The project can be found in my [repository](https://github.com/Kani999/nodejs-rest-api).
