**When**: June 14â€“16 2019
**Where**: Ostrava at a former coal mine complex Hlubina


This year I will attend the PyCon conference for the first time. I'm curious about what awaits me. This is a three-day event.

Talks are prepared for the first two days.
Last day is prepared for workshops.
I am most interested in the topic of search engines and therefore the talk about **INTRO TO SEARCH USING PYTHON** excites me most. And I hope I'll get a free seat at the **BUILD YOUR SERVERLESS SLACKBOT** workshop.

This is the fifth year and the responses are great. I think there's something to look forward to.

*Are you also going to PyCon?*
