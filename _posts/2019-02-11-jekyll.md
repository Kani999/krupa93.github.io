I've made a decision between two ways how to create this website. WordPress vs. Jekyll.

For the type of information that this site will contain, WordPress is a bit overkill, and moreover, the percentage of attack at WordPress sites is increasing. Also hosting is not the cheapest. In addition, I do not need a CMS system for my needs.

Jekyll is a simple static page generator. We can hosts a website on Github Pages that support fully this tool. They even provide prepared templates.
You don't need to install any database or other servers. For a simple blogging site purpose, where the posts can be written in a Markdown language, it is perfect.

I'm working with this tool for the first time, so I'll have to get used to more advanced features. For now, I'm using the [feeling-responsive](https://github.com/Phlow/feeling-responsive) template that provides easy and clear documentation.
